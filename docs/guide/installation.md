For advanced users who prefer manual installation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/9aia/strigi
   ```

2. **Change Directory and Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd strigi
   bun install
   ```

3. **Build the Standalone Binary:**

   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

   This will create a standalone executable file for Strigi within the `dist/` directory.

4. **(Optional) Move the Binary to Your PATH:**

   The generated binary might not be accessible from anywhere in your terminal by default. To make it accessible system-wide, you'll need to move it to a directory included in your PATH environment variable. Consult your system's documentation for specific instructions on managing PATH variables.
