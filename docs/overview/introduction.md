## Goals

- **Simplify CLI interaction**: Strigi aspires to bridge the gap between users and the command line by transforming natural language into corresponding CLI commands, removing the need for extensive memorization of complex syntax.
- **Enhance command understanding**: Strigi strives to go beyond mere command generation. It seeks to empower users by providing detailed explanations for existing commands, fostering a deeper understanding of their functionalities and purposes.
- **Boost user productivity**: By streamlining command generation and explanation, Strigi aims to expedite workflows and enhance user productivity within the command line environment.

## Scope

Strigi's primary focus lies on assisting users with:

* **Natural Language Command Generation:**  Create commands effortlessly by describing your desired actions in plain English.
* **Interactive Command Refinement:** Review and customize generated commands for accuracy and personal preferences.
